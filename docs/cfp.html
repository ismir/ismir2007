CFP - ISMIR 2007 - 8th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval
</h1><h2>ISMIR 2007 Call for Submissions</h2><h4 style="text-decoration: line-through">Submission deadline: Wednesday April 11<sup>th</sup> 2007 (23:59 GMT)</h4><h4>Extended submission deadline: Wednesday April 18<sup>th</sup> 2007 (23:59 GMT)</h4><h3> Description and Introduction </h3><p>
The 8th International
Conference on Music Information Retrieval, ISMIR
2007, will be held at the Vienna University of Technology in Vienna,
Austria, from Sunday, September 23rd to Thursday, September 27th, 2007.
</p><p>
The annual ISMIR Conference is the established international forum for
those working on accessing digital musical material. It reflects the
tremendous recent growth of available music-related data and the
consequent need to search within it to retrieve music and musical
information efficiently and effectively. These concerns are of
interest to academia, industry, entertainment, and education. ISMIR
therefore aims to provide a place for the exchange and discussion of
news, issues, and results, by bringing together researchers and
developers, educators and librarians, students and professional users,
working in fields that contribute to this multidisciplinary domain.
Alongside presentations of original theoretical and practical
work, ISMIR provides introductory and in-depth tutorials in
specific domains and showcases current products and systems.
</p><h3> Topics </h3><p>

retrieval (MIR), including, but not limited to, the following topics

published, nor be under review for presentation elsewhere. Authors are
required explicitly to demonstrate the relevance of their methods to
MIR, and are strongly encouraged to include aural music examples in
their presentations (preferably using
copyright-free or copyright-cleared examples), and to address evaluation of their work (using benchmark data where possible).
</p><p>
We invite submissions in the categories of long paper, short paper, poster/demo,
tutorial, panel and exhibit.
All paper and poster/demo submissions to ISMIR 2007 will be
handled in electronic format via the submission web page, which will be linked
from the ISMIR 2007 web site:
<a href="index.html">http://ismir2007.ismir.net</a>.
Templates for LaTeX and MS Word will also be available from this site.
</p><p>

</li>
<li> Panels

A roster of special panels is planned. Panels should be lively,
